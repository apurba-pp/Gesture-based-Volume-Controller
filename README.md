# Gesture-based-Volume-Controller
#### The project uses openCV to detect the distances between "the tip of thumb" and "the tip of index finger". Then pycaw is used to proportionate the previously mentioned distance with our system volume.
#### The Handtrackmodule in src helps to return back the live location of any of the 21 points present in our hand.
